Some Public Sites I'm particularly Proud of

Here are some sites that I developed or contributed to. I am happy to recreate any of the functionality found in these sites.

http://emotorrepair.com/ (html, SASS, jQuery, server management with Digital Ocean);

https://www.mlelectronics.com/ (php, laravel, mySQL, html, sass, javascript);

http://goldstarvegetarian.com/  (php, angularJS, SASS, html, jQuery, mySQL);
